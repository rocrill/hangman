# Hangman

Hangman is a Python terminal game, which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.

Users can try to beat the computer by guessing letters in the randomly generated word, based on the number of letters in the word. Players have a limited number of wrong guesses they can make before the hangman Ascii diagram is complete, at which point the game ends.
